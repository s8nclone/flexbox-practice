# flexbox-practice
Practicing creating responsive layouts using flexbox.
I used presaved png images from my local directory, it ruins the beauty but the idea is to understand the concept and get it right
It is not the best but it is another step in the right direction, kindly endure!

practice project from : internetingishard.com
